# How I Prepared For FAANG Interviews Without CS Degree.

I got in Amazon(AWS). It took one and a half years in total for the prepartion. I literally started from zero for entire preparation. I don't disagree it takes longer than usual. It was a really long journey for me. It took that long for me because:

* No Computer Science degree in colleage. My major was Economics.
* My previous company didn't ask me any technical background or knowledge. I was working as Software Engineer at my previous company but I didn't prepare for techinical interviews. It was my first technical role in my career. 

I would like to share how I prepared for interviews.

## My Study History

**Sep 2022** :
   ![leetcode_history_2022.png](https://github.com/harunawaizumi/ffang-interviews-preparations/blob/main/leetcode_history_2022.png) 
   I started studying algorithm in Sep 2022. I used [Structy](https://structy.net/) to understand fundamentals. After repeating two to three times depending on the topic, I started working on Leetcode. I focused on [Top 100 Liked Questions](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-100-liked-questions/) and [60 Questsions To Solve](leetcode.com/problem-list/xo2bgr0r/). My golden time to study is in the morning before working hours. I usualy woke up at 5am to study from 5am - 7am. On weekend, I treid to study for at least 6 hours each. One dail goal was solving at least 1 question, and 2 questsions on averate. Don't go to next question until I unerstand really well.

**2023** :
   ![leetcode_history_2023.png](https://github.com/harunawaizumi/ffang-interviews-preparations/blob/main/leetcode_history_2023.png)
   Hiring freeze started in the late 2022 and the early 2023. Many teams in FAANG stopped hiring people. My strategy needs to be changed. I thought the demands of cloud engineers are going to increase in the future and my previous company also uses AWS. I studied for 6 months to get [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/). I didn't study seriously from Aug. to Oct. I enjoyed having trips. I resumed an interview preparations in Nov 2023. I studied System Design and Algorithm. I also increased study hours. I woke up at 4am to study for 3 hours and studied for at least 6 hours each on weekend. I used [Algoexport System Design Fundamentals](https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/fundamentals) and made a note for each topic.

**2024** :
   ![leetcode_history_2024.png](https://github.com/harunawaizumi/ffang-interviews-preparations/blob/main/leetcode_history_2024.png)
When I have some questions I don't understand, I talk to senior engineers I respect. After discussion, I realized Algoexpert System Design Fundamentails are not enough to pass FAANG interviews. I also read [Alex Xu System Design Interview](https://amzn.asia/d/0Tflea2) and [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/). These two books gives some good idea how to approach system design interviews. I started applying for companis in May and got an offer from Amazon in August.

## My Study Schedule
I used excel to make a daily study schedule. I made a daily plan on the first day of each month using excel and track whether I complited my daily task.
Making a daily plan and following the plan helped me motivated. When you looked at your study schedule history, you can see what you learned, how you improved and how long it would take to finish a new material. I didn't put much tasks on Sunday. I used Sunday for catching up tasks I didn't complete in the week to stick to my weekly plan.

I studied in the early morning on weekdays and daytimes on weekend. There are two or three cafes I really like in my neighborhood. I usually picked one of them to study on weekend. 
Having a place or environtment which makes you easily focus on and get things done is important. I easily focus on studying in the early morning at home. It's very quiet and no distruction. My brain is clear in the morning. I woked up at 4am or 4:30am, made coffee and studied (Don't look at SNS before you study!) was my favorite morning routine.

## Algorithm

### Which Material To Use
* **[Structy](https://structy.net/)** : I definitely recommend structy especially for those who want to learn algorithm questions without any experience by themselve! It goes through a different type of data structure in each module. You will start out with fundamentals and each lesson builds on the last. A founder,Alvin, is amazing. He explains how to solve a question in a very easy way. It gives a grett fundation in problem solving strategy and pattern. After you finish all topics, you probably get some idea when you want to use a certain data structure, why you want to use it, and how you want to explain a solution to others using a whiteboard. I repeated ** three times ** to understand better. If you have learned algorithm in colleage, you wouldn't need it.

* **[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)** : This is one of the most popular algorithm questions platform in the world. I used Leetcode after I became comfortable with Structy. Premious subsciption is recommended ! Some of good questions are only for premium users. You can also sort questions by frequency asked by top IT companies and official answers for questions. I understand all of them you could get for free somewhere on the internet. But you can save lots of time by paying just $160. A engineer from Google told me that you need to solve at 200 - 300 questions to pass FAANG technical interviews. The ideal percentage is like 10% Hard, 20% Medium and 70% easy. I solved 223 questions in total. I would need to solve more "Hard" questions if I planed to apply for a regular SWE. The positions I wanted to apply for was either of engineering roles which requires some client faicing skills, or non-software engineering role among technical positions. I more focused on fundamental questions. I repeated one to six times until I solve a question quickly.

* **[AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions)** : This is another algorithm questions platform. I used it for topics I'm not strong at. For example, I didn't have confident about Heap, Recuresive, Dynamic Programming and Sliding Windows. AlgoExpert groups algorithm questions by topics. Its questions are similar to Leetcode and good questions are selected. It provided good video explanations. After solving Easy, Medium and Hard questions for these topics using AlgoExpert, I became confident about any algorithm topic.

### Which question to practice
I solved [Top 100 Liked Questions](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-100-liked-questions/) and [60 Questsions To Solve](leetcode.com/problem-list/xo2bgr0r/). These questisons are frequently asked by big companies. I made a list in excel with these questions.
I tried to solve 2 questions daily from the top to bottom in the list.
I also wrote down my progress in the list. 
[![Must To Solve Questions](https://github.com/harunawaizumi/ffang-interviews-preparations/blob/main/leetcode_tracker.mp4)]

Green means "I solved it smoothly without any reference".
Yellow means "I almost solved it, or managed to solve it but it took longer than it needs".
Orange means "I couldn't solve it".  
On the second turn, I skipped questions in green. I only tried ones in yellow and orange. I repeated three times. 
After repeating three times, I found which topic I'm not good at. AlgoExpert is good to strength weak points. It picks up frequently asked questions and questions are not exactly the same as ones in Leetcode. I solved questions related to these topics. After solving them multiple times, it gives me some good some good idea about how to approach these questions and give good confident.   


### How to solve a quesetion 
When solving a question, I tried to simulate a real interview as much as possible.
Set 20mins timer and solve a question without any material. It's ok to extend a time if I can't solve it but don't waste time to just think a question for hours. Speak it out in imagining talking to an interviewer. 

1. Clearify a Question 
	"Can this array/variable/tree be null ?"
	"Can this variable be zero ?" 
	"Can this variable/number be negative ?" etc. 
	
2. Explain Your Idea
	start with a bruce force solution and give time/space complexity.
	give other solutions and give time/space complecity. 
	compare all solutions and explain pros/cons. 
	pick one optimized solution among them.
	start writing a code.
This youtube provided by Google was helpful.
[Google Example Coding/Engineering Interview](https://youtu.be/XKu_SEDAykw?si=tD5OTMzfvmszaky7)
	
	
4. Check an answer
	Try to understanding a solution fully without remembering it.
   	Set 20mins timer to solve the same question again without looking at the answer.  
	If you don't solve it smoothly within 20mins, check the answer and repeat again until you solve it smoothly.
	
### How to Simulate an Algorithm Interview
1. Paper
	I wrote an answer on a paper before writing a code while explaining my answer. I try to always use either of paper of whiteboard to draw my answer.

2. Whiteboard
	I bought a big whiteboard to practice. 
	I used a whiteboard to write a solution before writing a code after solving the first time.
	I tried to imagine an interviewer sitting in front of me while writing an answer on the whiteboard.
	
3. Mock Interview
	There are multiple free mock interview website to practice on the internet. 
	I used [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/) which provide free pair mocking interview practice. The system matches another person, solve an question and give feedback. 
	I tried 7 times. I stopped using it because it provides the same questions again and again after trying multiple times.
   	It was helpful to simulate an real interview.


## System Design
I needed to start with very fundamental because I don't have Computer Siecense degree and didn't have chance to study it much.

1. Algo Export
Algo Expert has a system design fundamental tutorial which has 25 videos. 
I watched a video and wrote down a summary for each topic. I also checked and searched to understand deeply.
![Tech Basic](https://github.com/harunawaizumi/ffang-interviews-preparations/blob/main/tech_basic_tracker.mp4)


2. Review and Remember
 After watching this video twice, I made a list to remember them. I asked a question and explained to myself. I tracked when I answered and whether I answered correctly.
![Tech Basic](https://github.com/harunawaizumi/ffang-interviews-preparations/blob/main/tech_basic_tracker.png)

3. Move To Advance
I read [Alex Xu System Design Interview](https://amzn.asia/d/0Tflea2) and [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) and wrote down what I learned to my note.
![System Design Note](https://github.com/harunawaizumi/ffang-interviews-preparations/blob/main/sd_note.png)


4. Practice
I made my template to lead System Design interviews. I follow this steps.
* Clearify the service and explain to an interviewer.
  - Instagram is a phone and video sharing social networking service. 
* Explain what kind of data we need.
  - posts(text, video, pictures), users and followers.
* Ask function we should focus on
  - Should we focus on uploading and read  posts ?
  - Should we focus on following users ?
* Ask any unfunctional requirements we should care
  - Do we want to make it scalable ?
  - Do we wnat to make it reliable ?
  - Do we want to keep a low latency ?
* Clearify Numbers
  - The number of daily users
  - How many posts a user upload and read ? --> You can calculate the size of the service.
  - The size of pictures/videos and how long should we store it ? --> You can calculate the size of storage.
* Draw a high-level design
  - Include user, application server, Database
  - Start with a simple architecture.
  - Ignore scalability, reliability and latency for now.
* Discuss Database
  - SQL vs NoSQL --> Explain pros & cons. Discuss which is better for this scenario.
  - Object storage for video, song and images --> Explain why object storage is good. Explain cloud option.
  - RDB for meta data --> Explain why RDB is good for meta data.
* Discuss Application Server
  - When a popular user posts (Change the scenario of high traffic depending on the service), a service is overloaded if there is only one server. The amount of the traffic one server can handler is limited. We can introduce Load Balancer...... Explain what it is. The type of LB. How to decide the number of LB. How to distribute a traffic etc.
* Scalability and Reliabiliry
  - Database replication
  - Load balancer
* Latency
  - Browser caching (Cliend side)
  - Database caching (server side caching)
  - CDN
  - Database sharding
* Security (Optional)
  - How to secure a system
  - How to secure API
  - How to secure Database
  - Vulnability

## Behavioral Question
I talked to some of my friends working for Google, Amazon to know how to prepare for behavioral questions. 
Amazon expect interviewees to answer my experience using STAR method. I prepared for behavioral questions usgin [STAR method](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/in-person-interview). I wrote down my 6 highlights of experiences for last 8 years and summarized it. 

For each experience, I thought these points: 
- STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Why I did this ?
- What I learned ?
- How could I improve if I have chance to do it again ?
- Why did I fail it or why did I succeed in it ?
- What was difficult in my actions ?
- How did I make it more creative, efficient or improved ?

I organized my experiences before I started applying for companies. I practiced 2 or 3 topics weekly. 
When I practiced a behavioral question, I looked at myself through mirror to practice, or recorded my answer to review late. 
I also used Zoom/Meetup to pretend to be in a interview. I tried to look at camera in Mac instead of looking at participats in a meeting. 
An interviewer would probably have better chance to think you are really looking at the interviwer if you look at the camera itself while you are talking. It needs some practice because it's not really comfortable to spead looking at the camera instead of looking at a participat in a meeting. 
My point is that looking at yourself answering questions objectively helped improved my behavioral question interviews.
