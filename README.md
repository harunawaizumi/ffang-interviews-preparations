I got in Amazon(AWS). It took one and a half years in total for the prepartion. I literally started from zero for the entire preparation. The reason it took that long for me was 

* No Computer Science degree in colleage. My major was Economics.
* My previous company didn't ask me any technical background or knowledge. I was working as Software Engineer at my previous company which was my first technical role in my career. 

I would like to share what I have done to prepare for interviews.

## Algorithm

### Which Material To Use
* **[Structy](https://structy.net/)** : I definitely recommend structy especially for those who want to learn algorithm questions without any experience by themselve! It goes through a different type of data structure in each module. You will start out with fundamentals and each lesson builds on the last. A founder,Alvin, is amazing. He explains how to solve a question in a very easy way. It gives a grett fundation in problem solving strategy and pattern. After you finish all topics, you probably get some idea when you want to use a certain data structure, why you want to use it, and how you want to explain a solution to others using a whiteboard. I repeated ** three times ** to understand better. If you have learned algorithm in colleage, you wouldn't need it.

* **[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)** : This is one of the most popular algorithm questions platform in the world. I used Leetcode after I became comfortable with Structy. Premious subsciption is recommended ! Some of good questions are only for premium users. You can also sort questions by frequency asked by top IT companies and official answers for questions. I understand all of them you could get for free somewhere on the internet. But you can save lots of time by paying just $160. 

A engineer from Google told me that you need to solve at 200 - 300 questions to pass FAANG technical interviews. The ideal percentage is like 10% Hard, 20% Medium and 70% easy. I solved 223 questions in total. I would need to solve more "Hard" questions if I planed to apply for a regular SWE. The positions I wanted to apply for was either of engineering roles which requires some client faicing skills, or non-software engineering role among technical positions. I more focused on fundamental questions. I repeated one to six times until I solve a question quickly.



* AlgoExpert 

### Which question to practice
I seatched "which questions are frequently asked in FAANG" on the internet and made a list in excel.
I tried to solve 2 questions daily from the top to bottom in the list.
I also wrote down my progress in the list. 
Green means "I solved it smoothly without any reference".
Yellow means "I almost solved it, or managed to solve it but it took longer than it needs".
Orange means "I couldn't solve it".  
On the second turn, I skipped questions in green. I only tried ones in yellow and orange. I repeated three times. 
After repeating three times, I found which topic I'm not good at. The topics I was weak at were graph, backtracking, dynamic programming and heap. 
AlgoExpert is good to strength weak points. It picks up frequently asked questions and questions are not exactly the same as ones in Leetcode.
I solved questions related to these topics. After solving them multiple times, it gives me some good some good idea about how to approach these questions and give good confident.   


### How to solve a quesetion 
When solving a question, I tried to simulate a real interview as much as possible.
Set 20mins timer to see whether I can solve it or not. It's ok to extend a time when I can't solve it but don't waste time to just think a question for hours. Speak it out in imagining talking to an interviewer. 
1. Clearify a question 
	"Can this array be null ?"
	"Can this variable be zero ?" 
	"Can this number be negative ?" etc. 
	
2. Explain your idea
	start with a bruce force solution and give time/space complexity.
	give other solutions and give time/space complecity. 
	compare all solutions and explain pros/cons. 
	pick one optimized solution among them.
	start writing a code. 
	
	
3. Check an answer
	Try to fucous on understanding a solution instead of remembering it.
	Solve the same question again without looking at the answer with a 20mins timer. 
	If you don't solve it smoothly within 20mins, check the answer again and repeat until you solve it smoothly.
	
### How to simulate an interview
1. Whiteboard
	I bought a big whiteboard to practice. 
	I started using a whiteboard to write a solution after the second time.
	I tried to imagine an interviewer sitting in front of me while writing an answer on the whiteboard.
	
2. Mock Interview
	There are multiple free mock interview website to practice on the internet. 
	I used Pramp which provide free pair mocking interview practice. The system matches another person, solve an question and give feedback. 
	I tried 7 times. I stopped it because the system provides the same questions I have solved before after trying multiple times.
	But it was helpful to simulate an real interview.


## System Design
I needed to start with very fundamental because I don't have Computer Siecense degree. My major was Economis/Business.
I was working as software engineer in a headge fund which is my first IT career in my life. I was not asked any technical questions before I joined the company. 
I really appreciate the hedgefund let me in withtout any techinical knowledge but for that reason, I didn't have change to learn IT fundamental.

1. Algo Export
Algo Expert has a system design fundamental tutorial which takes X hours to finish it. 
I watched a video to write down a summary for each topic. I also checked and searched to understand deeply when I didn't understand a topic. 
I made a list like this. 

2. Review and Remember
